Overview of the Projects:

Project 1: Development of a Quiz Application Using JavaScript
This project involved the creation of an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at improving user engagement and learning. The application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions one at a time and provides instant feedback on each selectionâ€”indicating whether the response is correct or incorrect. Key features include real-time feedback, score tracking, and a final score summary at the end of the quiz. The application logic was implemented using vanilla JavaScript without external libraries, focusing on event handling, dynamic DOM manipulation, and state management. This project showcases the ability to build responsive and user-friendly web-based educational tools.
